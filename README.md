# Scala collections backed by [GS Collections](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections)

This was motivated by

* A [presentation](https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/scala-collections-performance) showing that GS collections significantly outperform Scala's collections.
* A [request](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/818) for ideas towards a new collection library.
